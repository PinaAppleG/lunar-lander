[Tell me more.](http://k40s.net/183/lunar-lander/)\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n\r\nThis application depends on:\r\n\r\n- **Linux** because Windows(r)(tm) is ~~crap~~ not compatible.\r\n- **Build tools**. Mainly gcc, make and some other stuff. \r\n- **A VT1000 compatible terminal emulator** for the color output (bash is one).\r\n\r\nJust run ```make``` if you have all depencies and ```make install``` to install if you wish to. ```make clean``` will clean the project up.\r\n\r\n## About this game\r\n\r\nLunar Lander was the first-ever PC game written in 1967 by a student. It was originally written in BASIC, but there are plenty of other languages out there in which this game is written. @nicolaisueper and myself go to the same school where we had to pick a topic for a project we had to do. We decided to write a text-based game in C. As we stumbled upon lunar-lander at [technologizer](http://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/) we decided to write a similar program like this in C. \r\n\r\nSo we took a look at the BASIC sources which we got [here](http://www.vintage-basic.net/bcg/lunar.bas) and began writing. Now the final version of our program is finished and we are just about to begin working on a GUI version of this.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\nSo far the only contributors are: @nicolaisueper and @k3ll4gr0up.","google":"UA-44457715-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
