Mainly gcc, make and some other stuff. \r\n\r\nJust run ```make``` if you have all depencies and ```make install``` to install. ```make clean``` will clean the project up.\r\n\r\n## About this game\r\n\r\nLunar Lander was the first-ever PC game written in 1967 by a student. It was originally written in BASIC, but there are plenty of other languages out there in which this game is written. And now, it's just one more. \r\n\r\nWe don't lean too much on the original sources. This program ist just a similar game. no exact C-copy of it.\r\n","google":"UA-44457715-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
