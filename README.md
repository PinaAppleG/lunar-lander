# Lunar Lander [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/k3ll4gr0up/lunar-lander.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/k3ll4gr0up/lunar-lander)


This is a port in C of the original "Lunar Lander" video game, which is written in BASIC.

## Building

This application depends on:

-Linux because Windows(r)(tm) is crap.
-Basic build tools. Mainly gcc, make and some other stuff. 

Just run ```make``` if you have all depencies and ```make install``` to install. ```make clean``` will clean the project up.

## About this game

Lunar Lander was the first-ever PC game written in 1967 by a student. It was originally written in BASIC, but there are plenty of other languages out there in which this game is written. And now, it's just one more. 

We don't lean too much on the original sources. This program ist just a similar game. no exact C-copy of it.
